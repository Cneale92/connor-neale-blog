## Personal Blog Goal
This is a blog created using html, css and javscript. It's purpose is to highlight how basic web APIs work. It is two separate webpages. The home webpage is a form to fill out and add blog posts. Each person can enter a username then title and add content to their posts. The submit will send the posts to the second page and store it in localstorage. There is also a dark mode toggle. I have been struggling because my image keeps disconnecting when the dark mode is toggling on and I am not sure why. I have tried to relink and rename it based on the console error. It continues to disconnect. I also messed up my orginal repo. I wasn't sure how to fix it so I created a new last minute. I pasted my code in the new repo and this may have caused the issue.
